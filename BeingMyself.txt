Hey everyone,
I am Diya Patel.
I am in 1st Year CSE student here in Manipal.
I am hardcore Gujarati, who is still in search of GOOD Gujarati Food("OUTSIDE GUJARAT")!!
There is nothing interesting about me.
I am pretty much a average, shy human, who only never likes being the center of attention.
I love Reading, Listening to music, Travelling and MATHEMATICS.
